      <h2>💌 it all started when...  </h2>
      <p>
      it all started when i saw your ig story back in the 17th of september, 2023. YES 2023 pa tayo nagstart magusap. grabe diba 😳. anyways, i saw your ig story about sa song na inupload mo sa sound cloud dati. i remember seeing that song way back in shs sa sound cloud after i searched your name out of sheer curiosity 😏. i think i heard you sing sa isang subject and at that time, i was still using sound cloud a lot since nawalan me spotify 😷. to my surprise, may lumabas ngang profile. i clicked it and saw ur “jealous” by nick jonas song cover 🥰. i listened to it a couple of times while thinking “hala ang galing nga niya kumanta” 🥳. may times din na i’d randomly play my songs and yours would play kasi i had it in my history. anyways, im getting distracted 😩

      <h2>remember when...</h2>
      <p>
        remember when i replied to that story of urs? it took a lot of courage to send that message knowing na ang tagal natin di nagusap and cause i still had the impression na galit ka sakin since shs 😭. i didn’t get a reply until two days later. sobrang takot and nahiya ako non kasi i really thought you ignored me 😭. ayun we caught up naman after that! i also used that excuse kung bakit kita chinat in the first place 😚. then we talked and talked after that. then one day, i garnered enough courage to ask you out for a coffee. i was so scared na hindi ka sisipot non 🫠. mali ko rin naman, no early notice or whatnot 🤣. i was scared na we wouldnt vibe well as we did sa chat, pero im glad i was wrong. i did all those because i told you na even back in shs, i always paid attention to you. IT’S BECAUSE YOU’RE GOATED 🐐🥳
